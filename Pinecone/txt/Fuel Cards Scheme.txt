In accordance with directives from the HR Committee's 13th meeting on September 13, 2023, management has reviewed the current cash-based allowance system, opting to transition to PSO Fuel Cards to align with prevailing market practices.

The Pakistan State Oil PSO, a state-owned enterprise, has agreed to waive the initial card fee and reduce the maintenance fee from 1.75% to 0.5%, with potential for further reduction.

Under the proposed scheme:
- Employees of Grades G-3, G-4, G-5, G-6 and G-7 will receive a fuel card with existing fuel allowance limits.
- Employees in Grades G-1 & G-2 will replace the Rs 8,000 monthly conveyance allowance with a fuel limit of 80 liters per month, necessitating an amendment to the existing Benefit Grid for PSW Employees.

Employees can withdraw unused balances twice yearly 31st December & 30th June, subject to withholding taxes.

The transition offers benefits including streamlined expense management, real-time tracking, customizable spending limits, enhanced security, and reduced tax deductions.

Financial Impact: Assuming Rs 270 per liter fuel cost, Grades G-3, G-4, G-5, G-6 and G-7 see no financial impact. Grades G-1 & G-2 will incur approximately Rs 1.5 million monthly due to the fuel card transition.

Approval is sought from the Board after HR Committee review for:
- Amending the compensation and benefits grid.
- Ceasing the Rs 8,000 conveyance allowance for Grades G-1 & G-2 in favor of fuel cards.
- Allowing biannual withdrawal of balances with applicable taxes.

CHRO & CFO
Subject: Issuance of Employees PSO Fuel Cards in Lieu of Fuel Allowance

Following the HR Committee's directive from its 13th meeting on September 13, 2023, management has reviewed the feasibility of transitioning from the current cash-based fuel allowance system to a PSO Fuel Card system. This transition aims to align our employment benefits with industry standards while offering several advantages in expense management and employee convenience.

To facilitate this change, we propose adopting PSO as our fuel card provider, leveraging their extensive network and services. The transition will require amending the Compensation and Benefits grid, previously approved by the Board via Resolution No 10 dated May 3, 2021.

A detailed working paper supporting this proposal is attached in Annex-A. The estimated financial impact, primarily due to substituting the conveyance allowance with fuel cards for Grades G-1 & G-2, is approximately Rs 1.5 million monthly.

Pending favorable HR Committee recommendations, we seek the Board's approval to:
- Amend the Compensation and Benefits grid.
- Replace the Rs 8,000 conveyance allowance for Grades G-1 & G-2 with PSO Fuel Cards.
- Allow biannual balance withdrawals subject to taxes.
