Overview

Pakistan Single Window (PSW) recognizes the importance of high-quality human resources to its success. This performance management policy aims to establish a formal process for setting goals, providing feedback, and conducting performance evaluations. It seeks to enhance employee performance through regular check-ins and evaluations, fostering accountability, and continuous improvement.

Background

In the absence of a formal Performance Management System, the appraisals for FY 21-22 were conducted using a 9-box grid as an interim measure. An external consultant from USAID-PREIA was engaged to develop a comprehensive Performance Management Policy for PSW. This policy was formulated with stakeholder engagement and awareness sessions for employees in Karachi and Islamabad.
