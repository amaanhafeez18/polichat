Succession Planning

1. Introduction

PSW operates on a performance-driven culture which emphasizes effective talent management and business continuity in all departments. Succession planning is essential for both short-term and long-term strategies in retaining and developing existing talent for future leadership roles.

2. Purpose

The main purpose of the Succession Planning process is to ensure the timely availability of the right talent at the right time and at the right organizational level. This planning process will help PSW in:

- Identifying critical positions starting from the top tier of the company and identifying potential successors as per defined criteria
- Developing, planning, and executing succession planning and career development processes for potential staff members to continue operations and lead the company in coming years
- Ensuring talent is rewarded and recognized as well as retained for future growth
- Designing and ensuring training and development processes for potential successors across the organization
- Giving a career path to star performers and helping nurture internal talent
- Ensuring business continuity in case of unavailability of internal resources due to factors such as prolonged leave, illness, immediate resignations, or other unforeseen circumstances
- Maintaining talent availability within PSW by recruiting external resources as and when required

3. Procedure

The succession planning program will be carried out as follows:

a. HR Department will initiate the Succession Planning process by sending a company-wide broadcast to all the senior leadership at the start of the year.

b. HR Department will generate a company-wide list of all employees in an excel sheet.

c. HR Department will identify critical/key positions and the person holding critical positions in consultation with the HoDs and the CEO and update the information in the excel sheet.

d. Based on the available performance information, HR Department will identify potential candidates as successors for critical positions and submit the same for approval to the CEO.

e. If the successor is not available, a job requisition can be raised, and the position can be advertised subject to approval as per the Recruitment & Selection process.

f. If a successor is available, HR Department will work alongside the CEO and HOD of the relevant department to carry out a GAP Analysis using the 9-Grid matrix.

g. The GAP Analysis or assessment of the successor would be based on three parameters:
   i. Ready to move to the next position immediately.
   ii. Ready to move to the next position in one year.
   iii. Ready to move to the next position in the next two years.

h. After the GAP Analysis, a final list will be prepared for potential successors and shared with the relevant HODs and CEO for their comments and feedback.
