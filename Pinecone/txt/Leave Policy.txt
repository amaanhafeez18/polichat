This policy has been designed to create a clear and comprehensive framework for managing employee leaves in a fair and consistent manner. It outlines the types of leaves available, procedures for requesting and approving leaves, and the responsibilities of employees and management. 

The primary objective of the Employee Leave Policy is to establish a balanced approach to leave management that considers both employee well-being and operational requirements. 

The scope of the Leave Policy encompasses guidelines, rules, and procedures related to employee absences from work, including vacation, sick days, parental leave, and other forms of time off.

Employees must submit the Leave Application in advance. In emergencies or for Sick Leave, approval must be sought from the supervisor and the HR Department must be informed. Leave not applied through the ESS portal within 3 working days/payroll cut-off date will be considered leave without pay. Scheduled leaves require agreement considering both workloads and employee needs. Leave of absence for two days or more should be submitted at least 24 hours prior, except in cases of sickness and emergency. More than two weeks of leave requires submission through the ESS portal at least two weeks in advance. Over-staying approved leave without valid reason can result in disciplinary action. Weekends, gazetted, and public holidays do not count as leave days. Two types of leave cannot be availed consecutively without HOD approval. Casual leave of more than 2 days will be considered Annual leave. Leave extensions must be requested through the ESS portal before the current leave expires.

Verify leave balance through ESS before obtaining HODâ€™s signature. HR Department records all leaves/attendance through HRMS.
