Introduction:
Harassment is a prohibited practice including intimidation, oppression, exploitation, and discrimination. It undermines employee relations, damages morale, creates a stressed work environment, and interferes with productivity. PSW is committed to a harassment-free workplace, addressing harassment based on sex, age, caste, ethnicity, religion, disability, medical condition, marital status, or job responsibilities. This policy applies to all PSW employees, providing a means of redress for affected employees. PSW has a zero-tolerance policy against harassment and gender inequality, aligning with “The Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010”. Violations can lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal or termination, and court proceedings.

Policy
Workplace Harassment:
Harassment is any improper and unwelcome conduct that causes or might cause offense or humiliation. It includes harassment based on sex, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, or age. Forms of harassment include unwelcome verbal or physical conduct, hate literature, offensive jokes, ethnic slurs, or actions interfering with work performance or creating a hostile work environment. Minor harassment follows regular grievance procedures. Serious cases involving physical harm, extortion, or extreme mental duress follow sexual harassment procedures. All harassment incidents are reported to HR, which determines the case's seriousness and recommends further action. The matter may be discussed with the Sexual Harassment Committee. Disagreement, admonishment, criticism, or similar actions regarding work performance or conduct within a supervisory relationship are not normally considered harassment.

Abuse of Authority:
Abuse of authority is the improper use of influence, power, or authority by an employee against another person or group. It includes actions that influence career or employment conditions, such as appointments, assignments, contract renewals, performance evaluations, or promotions. Abuse of authority can be a single incident or a series of incidents and includes creating a hostile work environment through intimidation, threats, extortion, or coercion.

Sexual Harassment:
Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It is characterized by unwelcome behavior causing offense or humiliation, interference with work, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Sexual harassment can be a series of incidents or a single unambiguously offensive incident. Both male and female employees can be victims or offenders.

Evidence and Investigation:
Employees subjected to or witnessing harassment or bullying are encouraged to report incidents verbally or in writing to their supervisor, Head of Department, HR, or the CEO. Employees must cooperate in investigations; failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. Evidence includes detailed accounts from the complainant and accused, witness statements, and any relevant documents or recordings. Expert technical advice can be sought. Delay in filing a complaint does not affect the case's merits or procedure.

Procedure for Dealing with Sexual Harassment:
Employees have the right to confidentiality and may report sexual harassment directly to the HOD HR without approaching their supervisor. A four-member committee, including at least one female member, will handle complaints, reporting to the CEO. If the accused is a CEO or C-level executive, the BoD and chairman will assess the case. Upon receiving a complaint, the HOD HR will conduct a confidential fact-finding exercise. If the act was not sexual, informal mediation will resolve the issue. If the complaint persists, a formal procedure is initiated with a written complaint to the HOD HR. The Committee will gather statements and evidence confidentially, organize hearings, and submit a report with recommendations to the CEO or BoD.

Responsibility of Supervisors:
Supervisors and Heads of Departments must create and promote a safe and healthy environment. They are expected to take harassment allegations seriously and report them to the appropriate authority.
