Whistleblowing Policy

1. Introduction

Pakistan Single Window (the Company) is committed to conducting its operations with honesty and integrity. The Company is dedicated to working with all stakeholders including employees, suppliers, customers, and contractors in a lawful, ethically responsible manner that reflects the Company's values. PSW has adopted the General Code of Conduct (the Code) which outlines the principles and standards that should govern the actions of the Company and its employees. All staff members are expected to maintain high standards in accordance with applicable laws and the Code.

In line with applicable Laws, Regulations, Rules, and the Code, any actual or potential violation of the Code, regardless of its perceived insignificance, is a serious concern for the Company. Recognizing the importance of employees in identifying such violations, a Whistleblowing Policy and Protection Mechanism has been developed.

The Policy encourages employees, contractors, or any person to report suspected occurrences of any unethical, illegal, or inappropriate events without fear of retribution, to prevent them in the future. The whistleblowing protection mechanism enables all concerned to raise concerns within the Company rather than overlooking a problem or reporting it externally.

2. Purpose

a) To ensure that all cases of suspected wrongdoing and misconduct are reported and managed in a timely and appropriate manner.
b) To encourage the identification and reporting of improper, unethical, or inappropriate behavior at all levels of the Company.
c) To provide clear procedures for reporting such matters confidentially and taking corrective measures.
d) To administer and manage all disclosures in a timely, consistent, and professional manner.
e) To inspire confidence in all employees and associated individuals to question and raise concerns in the best interests of the Company.
f) To provide assurance that all disclosures will be taken seriously and to reassure whistleblowers of protection against reprisals or victimization.

3. Scope

Whistleblowing means the disclosure of information by any employee, contractor, or any person where they reasonably believe that one or more of the following events is happening, has happened in the past, or is likely to happen in the future:

- Civil unlawful or criminal acts
- Mismanagement of Company resources
- Acts detrimental to the interest or reputation of the Company or leading to a conflict of interest situation
- Failure to comply with any legal and regulatory obligations
- Acts of fraud, theft, or corruption
- Improprieties in financial and other matters
- Reporting incorrect financial data intentionally
- Unauthorized or illegal use of sensitive corporate data, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information
- Violations of the Code, Policies, SOPs, or applicable laws
- Violations of applicable health, safety, and environmental standards
- Unauthorized changes in the PSW systems or any of its components
- Acts that undermine the Companyâ€™s operations and objectives
- Deliberate concealment or attempts to conceal any of the above events

This list is not exhaustive. This Policy does not apply to employee career-related issues such as promotions, increments, transfers, relocations, or trainings, which should be addressed through the grievance redressal mechanism in the approved HR Policy.

4. Policy Statement and Applicability

4.1 Any improper, unethical, or inappropriate behavior within the Company is unacceptable and this is supported at the highest level.

4.2 This Policy applies to all stakeholders including employees, management, directors, vendors (such as contractors, suppliers, consultants, agents with whom the Company has agreements), customers, and any person associated with the Company. The Company shall make this policy known to all stakeholders.

4.3 All stakeholders are encouraged to disclose and communicate any concerns relating to ethical, safety, environmental, or other possible breaches of compliance.

5. Protection and Support for the Whistleblower

5.1 The Company encourages openness and will support staff raising genuine concerns in good faith under this Policy, even if the claim turns out to be untrue or presumptuous, except as provided in Section 8.3.

5.2 Complete confidentiality of whistleblowers shall be maintained, and they will be protected from any form of retaliation or victimization for genuinely held concerns raised in good faith.

6. Procedure

6.1 Any employee may raise a concern or complaint in writing with their line manager or a senior manager in the department. The concerned line manager or senior manager shall forward a copy of the concern or complaint to the Chief Internal Auditor.

6.2 Any concern or complaint may be lodged directly with the Chief Internal Auditor in writing on the Disclosure of Concern (Annexure A) or by calling +92-51-9211127. The whistleblower will be asked to formalize their concerns or complaints in writing either before or after the first meeting. Alternatively, the concern or complaint may be lodged by using the independent Speak Out email address speakout@psw.gov.pk.

6.3 The information listed below should be included in the concern or complaint as far as practicable:
   - An outline of the known or suspected wrongdoing
   - Details about what, when, where, and how it occurred
   - List of names of those suspected of being involved (both within or outside the Company)
   - List of names of anyone who may have relevant information

6.4 The whistleblower will not be expected to prove a suspected or actual wrongdoing. However, the whistleblower will be expected to provide evidence to the Internal Audit Department if they possess any proof or evidence relating to the suspected or actual wrongdoing.

6.5 The Internal Audit Department will contact the whistleblower and may schedule a meeting if required. Complete confidentiality relating to the details of the whistleblower shall always be maintained.

6.6 The whistleblower has the option of maintaining complete anonymity when reporting a violation (whether suspected or actual). Anonymous complaints shall be considered at the discretion of the Audit Committee upon the recommendation of the Chief Internal Auditor, keeping in view the seriousness of the issues raised and the likelihood of confirming the suspected or actual violation from reliable sources. However, anonymous reporting is not encouraged as it makes investigating the concern or complaint difficult.
