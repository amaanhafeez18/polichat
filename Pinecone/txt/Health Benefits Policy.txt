Executive Summary

The Pakistan Single Window Company (PSWC), incorporated under Section 42 of the Companies Act, 2017 in April 2020, was formally notified as the operating entity for the PSW system in June 2021. PSW organizational structure was put in place in January 2021 to operationalize the company and certain policies were implemented, including healthcare benefits. However, the current policy is deemed inequitable, discriminatory, and not aligned with best practices. A transition from salary-based medical allowances to a group health insurance plan is proposed to provide better coverage and cost savings. Implementation costs Rs. 29 million initially but saves Rs. 100 million over three years.

Background

Healthcare benefits impact turnover, recruitment, and costs. PSW offers medical allowances or group health insurance. The former is taxable and varies, disadvantaging lower-paid employees and domain officers.

Objectives

The proposed policy aims to provide equitable healthcare, improve benefits, and reduce financial strain.

Policy Options

Option 1: Adjust domain officers' medical allowances.
Option 2: Replace allowances with comprehensive group insurance.

Financial Impact

Option 2 costs Rs. 26 million for OPD and Rs. 24 million for IPD annually.

Risks

Implementing Option 2 may impact morale, cause resignations, affect recruitment, and lead to legal challenges.

Recommendation

Option 2 (i.e. Replace allowances with comprehensive group insurance, which costs Rs. 26 million for OPD and Rs. 24 million for IPD annually) is recommended, with a one-time salary adjustment to mitigate financial impacts.
