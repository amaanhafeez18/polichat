PSW EMPLOYEE REWARD & RECOGNITION POLICY

Introduction

The Employee Reward & Recognition policy is a compensation program that provides employees with additional monetary rewards for meeting or exceeding performance goals. PSW is committed to recognizing employees’ contributions to the overall objectives of the company. The company recognizes monetary rewards as a tool for encouraging, recognizing, and rewarding employee contributions, exemplary performance, and continuous service and believes that reward and recognition programs help maintain a high retention rate and encourage excellence in service to the company and its stakeholders. Accordingly, the company is developing and adopting both monetary and non-monetary reward programs for employees. The policy is part of the company’s overall strategy to create a performance-based culture where employees’ outstanding contributions, innovation, and extraordinary accomplishments are formally recognized by PSW management.

Objectives

The purpose of this policy is to enable the management to implement the reward and recognition initiatives and provide guidelines on the scope, proposed criteria, nomination, and approval process, which is in line with recommended best practices. The policy contains the following objectives:
