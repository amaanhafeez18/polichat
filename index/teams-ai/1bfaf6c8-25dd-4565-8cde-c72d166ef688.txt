**LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT (L&D) POLICY**

**1. Introduction**  
PSW operates on a knowledge-driven culture which means that the company believes in constant learning and growth. Having a learning culture in place enhances employee productivity, improves overall operational efficiency, and creates a talent pool with a high level of professional competence and up-to-date industry knowledge. This policy provides guidelines detailing the support the company shall provide for employees’ professional development and growth.

**2. Purpose**  
The main purposes of the learning & development policy are:  
a) To create and foster the growth of a knowledge-based environment within PSW.  
b) To develop a culture of learning and development where employees feel valued for their knowledge and skills, and their ability to impart knowledge to others.  
c) To ensure that the knowledge and skill base of PSW employees can fulfill the future needs of the company, mainly on the technology side.  
d) To maximize learning opportunities throughout PSW by developing indigenous resources and utilizing external resources to impart knowledge, sharpen existing skills, share best practices, and stimulate learning.  
e) To achieve a high level of employee satisfaction with learning and development activities.  
f) To measure and reward PSW employees for their efforts and contributions in developing a knowledge-based environment.

**3. Procedure**

**3.1. Identifying Learning & Development Needs**  
Identification of learning needs is the first phase of the learning & development program. It is based on the requirements of the individual employee and the needs of the company. After analyzing training needs, the Learning & Development department, in collaboration with Department Heads, will design an annual training plan. Learning needs can also be extracted after the performance review and succession planning process.

**3.2. Budget**  
Each year, the HR department will establish a comprehensive training budget covering the costs of internal/external training, workshops, seminars, professional memberships, certifications, e-learnings, and foreign training.

**3.3. Learning & Development Process**  
PSW provides the following two types of learning opportunities to employees:  
a) Formal learning opportunities  
b) Informal learning opportunities

**3.3.1. Formal Learning Opportunities**  
Formal learning opportunities refer to off-the-job training sessions conducted on specialized subjects/themes. These opportunities are identified by the employee in agreement with their HOD or through Training Need Assessment (TNA) exercises by the L&D department. Formal learning opportunities include:  
a) Training courses  
b) Attending conferences, workshops, seminars  
c) Exposure visits  
d) Professional certifications/exams/annual subscriptions (e.g., PMP, SHRM-CP/SCP, Six Sigma, CPA, ACCA, CA) and exam preparation courses  
e) Job rotation (moving employees to a different job role within the company)

**3.3.1.1. Formal Learning Opportunities Procedures**  
a) Employees or the HR department, as per the agreed L&D Plan, will identify and/or recommend the training course/conference/workshop, certifications, or exposure business visit.  
b) Employees will submit the case (including program details, course contents, cost, location, boarding and lodging or travel costs, time, learning objectives, and key outputs) after getting recommendations from their HOD to the HR department at least 2 weeks prior to the learning event on the L&D Plan. The HR department will evaluate the suitability of the learning course and cross verify with the L&D plan and recommend it to the CFO for final approval. For foreign training courses, the CEO will be the final approving authority.  
c) Employees may incur expenses only after receiving approval from HR. The employee must then submit the following documents to the finance department:  
   i. Application duly approved by HR.  
   ii. Invoice/Receipt of payment of expenses/subscription/fee.  
d) After concluding training, the employee must submit a certificate of completion or similar document and a professional development report (when applicable) to HR to be filed in the employee’s personnel file.  
e) In case of failure, this would constitute disqualification for any future opportunity.  
f) HR department has the sole right to enquire about the results produced at any point in time.  
g) PSW will not pay for an employee to retake a course.  
h) Any employee who had a learning & development opportunity outside Pakistan for which the organization has spent substantial funds, if he/she intends to leave the organization within one year after that L&D event, the organization has the right to deduct the cost of funds on a pro-rata basis at its discretion from the final settlement of that employee. An undertaking will be signed by the employee for all foreign training courses.  
i) In case an employee leaves during the training/certification program, the total cost incurred so far will be refunded or adjusted in the final settlement of that employee.

**3.3.2. Informal Learning Opportunities**  
Informal learning does not follow a structured approach and is thus considered a spontaneous learning style driven by the learner’s passion, curiosity, motivation, and objectives. It gives the learner control over the content they want to learn and the choice of resources for their learning. It is a self-paced learning approach that allows learners to gain knowledge and develop new skills at a time they’re most susceptible to learning. In the workplace, this can happen anytime and anywhere, even during interactions with colleagues that provide opportunities for sharing knowledge. Informal learning methods include:  
a) Using a computer-aided Learning package or e-learning;  
b) Training material shared by peers/reading books;  
c) Attending formal presentations or sessions to share learning.

**3.4. Responsibilities**  
The responsibility for developing skills and knowledge does not rest with the HR function alone. It is shared with individuals who must actively develop themselves and their managers who must demonstrate their commitment to train and develop their teams appropriately. Key responsibilities are as follows:

**3.4.1. Employee Responsibility**  
a) Identify their own learning and development needs and bring them to the attention of their line managers/HODs and HR, during a performance review or otherwise.

c) Attend learning and development activities when provided.  
d) Apply acquired skills & knowledge to the job and share with other colleagues.  
e) Deliver results after learning and development opportunities provided by the organization as per desired and agreed commitments.

**3.4.2. HOD/Line Manager Responsibility**  
a) Promote and encourage individuals & identified successors to undertake learning and development opportunities and coach them to help achieve their full potential.  
b) Ensure that the team actively participates in L&D activities to enhance overall performance.  
c) Provide timely, consistent, and appropriate feedback to the team regarding their L&D needs as per their job requirements and organizational needs.  
d) Ensure delivery of results committed and agreed after learning and development opportunities provided by the company.

**3.4.3. HR Responsibility**  
a) Ensure that the L&D policy is properly explained and communicated to all stakeholders.  
b) Plan, develop, and implement L&D activities in line with the available budget.  
c) Document and record all L&D activities through a Performance Management System or training need assessments.  
d) Keep track of available learning opportunities (both internally and externally) and provide support for L&D and succession planning.  
e) Evaluate, scrutinize, and recommend/not recommend L&D requests.  
f) Develop partnerships and networks to meet workforce development needs.

**4. Scope**  
L&D policy covers all employees of PSW (fixed term/deputationists).

**5. Applicability**  
This policy applies to all confirmed employees of PSW and officers on deputation. Any exception to this policy needs to be endorsed by the Board.

**6. Policy Statement**  
a) Learning and development take its mandate from one of the PSW core values, i.e., knowledge-driven through its people.

The Company reserves the right to change or withdraw all or any part of the policy at any

 time without giving prior notice to any person. Changes, if any, will be updated in the controlled copy of this policy.
