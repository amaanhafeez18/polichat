This Gender Action Plan (GAP) forms the basis for operationalizing the results and recommendations of the gender audit report. It contains specific gender elements to be considered in the operations of PSW and during the implementation of PSW measures and activities. Moreover, it helps to monitor the implementation of these measures and activities. Hence, the GAP ensures effective gender mainstreaming and integration of a consistent gender perspective in PSW to maximize benefits. The aim is to promote opportunities, drivers of change, and positive gender dynamics as well as to manage and mitigate potential adverse risks in PSW operations.

The GAP ensures instituting a process of compliance within PSW functions, including a) internal organizational HR, gender, and anti-harassment policies; and b) external PSW’s single subscription forms and PSW’s platforms such as the trade information portal, and port community system. The GAP aims to strengthen Pakistan Single Window (PSW)’s internal and external policies, systems, and procedures by mainstreaming gender considerations and compliance areas, establishing a baseline level of performance on gender integration within PSW.
