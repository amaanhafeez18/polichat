PROMOTION POLICY 
1. Introduction 
Pakistan Single Window (The company) considers employees as its most 
important asset whose creativity, hard work, and commitment drive PSW's 
innovation agenda and helps achieve organizational goals in an efficient and 
effective manner. In today's highly competitive market, it is a challenge to 
constantly attract 
and retain good talent. PSW believes that 
employee retention 
starts with creating a healthy work culture and recognizing people as individuals 
rather than replaceable resources. This belief leads to fostering and promoting a 
work culture based on mutual respect, teamwork, recognition, and appreciation 
of 
individual and collective contributions toward organizational goals. Providing 
opportunities for professional growth and development, and a stable and 
rewarding career path for its employees is therefore an essential component of 
the company's employee retention strategy. 
The PSW Promotion policy is a set of guidelines that define the employee 
eligibility criteria for promotion, and the process that needs to be followed for 
promoting employees. 
To ensure consistency and transparency in the promotion process, the 
Promotion policy is aligned with PSW's Performance Management, Recruitment 
and Selection, Retention, and Succession planning policies to facilitate the 
advancement, development, and career progression of the PSW talent pool. 
Promotion is solely based on performance and is neither 
automatic nor based on 
seniority or job tenure. 
2. Objectives 
The main purpose and objectives of the promotion policy are: 
• 
To provide a detailed framework to facilitate the advancement of PSW 
employees. 
• 
To set forth the criteria that must be followed for an employee to be 
eligible for 
the promotion. 
• 
To outline the process that must be followed by the management to 
consider an employee for promotion. 
• 
To ensure that the promotion process is standardized, fair, transparent, 
and purely based on merit. 
3. SCOPE 
The policy covers all employees of 
the company except for those mentioned in 
Section 5-Applicability. 
The policy covers the following types of employee promotions: 
• 
Horizontal promotion 
• 
Vertical promotion 
• 
Career Mobility promotion 
Page 2 of 10 
PROMOTION POLICY 
Horizontal promotions involve an increase in the title and pay for an employee 
within the same grade, but with little to no change in responsibilities. These 
promotions, also known as an "up-gradation," recognize employees who have 
performed well during the year and have demonstrated the capability to take 
on higher responsibilities with the company in due course of time and 
contribute actively to the achievement of the company's objectives as 
recommended by the Head of Department 
Vertical promotions are elevations to a higher grade. This involves upward 
movement, higher salaries, and more responsibilities. In other words, vertical 
promotions ask the employee to contribute more and give them a more senior 
seat at 
the table. This type of promotion may also change the nature of the job 
by adding leadership responsibilities or more direct reports. In PSW's case, this 
will typically involve a change in title, grade & increase in salary 
Career Mobility Promotion involves promoting an employee to a different 
department with a pay raise. This may or may not include a change in grade. ln this 
case, the employee will be considered only if 
they fulfill the minimum set criteria 
listed for the vacant position in another department. 
4. DEFINITIONS

Directors of the PSW Company.

Resource Department.
