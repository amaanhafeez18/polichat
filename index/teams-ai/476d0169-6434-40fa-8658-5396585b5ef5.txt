1. Introduction 
PSW operates on a knowledge-driven culture which means that the company believes in constant learning and 
growth. Having a learning culture in place does not only enhance employee productivity, improve overall 
operational efficiency but also creates a talent pool with a high level of professional competence and up-to-date 
industry knowledge. The learning & development policy will provide guidelines detailing the support the company 
shall provide for employees’ professional development and growth. 
 
2. Purpose:  
The main purpose of learning & development policy is;

b) To develop a culture of learning and development where employees feel valued because of their 
knowledge and skills, and their ability to impart knowledge to others.  
c) To ensure that the knowledge and skill base of PSW employees is such that it can fulfill the future needs

stimulate learning.  
e) To achieve a high level of employee satisfaction with the learning and development activities.

To measure and reward PSW employees for their efforts and contributions in developing a knowledge-
based environment. 
3. Procedure: 
 
3.1. Identifying Learning & Development Needs:

learning needs related to the requirements of the individual employee and the needs of the Company. After

Heads, will design an annual plan of training. Learning needs can also be extracted after the performance 
review and succession planning process.  
 
3.2. Budget: 
 
Each year HR department will conduct an exercise to establish a comprehensive training budget. This training 
budget would cover the costs of internal/external training, workshops/seminars/professional memberships,

is being conducted on a specialized subject/theme. The objective to get these formal learning opportunities

learning opportunity) after getting recommendations from his/her HOD to HR department, at least 2 
weeks prior to the learning event on L&D Plan. The HR department will evaluate the suitability of the 
learning course and cross verify with the L&D plan and after recommending will send it to the CFO 
for final approval. For foreign training courses, CEO will be the final approving authority.  
c) The employee may incur expenses only after receiving approval from HR. The employee must then

after that L&D event, the organization has a right to deduct the cost of funds on pro-rata basis on its 
discretion from final settlement of that employee. An undertaking will be signed by the employee for

i) 
In case an employee leaves during the training/certification program, the total cost incurred so far 
will be refunded or adjusted in the final settlement of that employee. 
3.3.2. Informal Learning Opportunities  
 
Informal learning does not follow a structured approach and is thus considered a spontaneous learning style 
that is driven by the learner’s passion, curiosity, motivation and objectives. It gives the learner control over 
the content they want to learn and the choice of resources for their learning. It is a self-paced learning 
approach that allows learners to gain knowledge and develop new skills at a time they’re most susceptible 
to learning. In the workplace, this can happen anytime and anywhere, even during interactions with 
colleagues that provide opportunities for sharing knowledge. There is a wide range of learning and 
development methods available that can be used informally. For example: 
 
a) Using a computer-aided Learning package or e-learning; 
b) Training material shared by peers/ reading books; 
c) Attending formal presentations or sessions to share learning; 
3.4. Responsibilities 
The responsibility for developing the skills and knowledge does not rest with the HR function alone. It is 
shared with the individuals who must actively develop themselves and their managers must demonstrate 
their commitment to train and develop their teams appropriately. Key responsibilities of employees, line 
manager/HOD, and HR are as follows: 
3.4.1. Employee Responsibility 
PSW recognizes the need for each employee to learn and develop their skills continuously and will support 
individuals to help them achieve this, as well as PSW expect from individuals to take on responsibility for 
their own self-development. Thus the employees would be responsible to:

managers/HODs and HR, during a performance review or otherwise. 
b) To take ownership of learning and exploring options and promote learning & development within the 
organization 
c) Must attend learning and development activities when provided. 
d) Apply acquired skills & knowledge to the job and sharing with other colleagues. 
e) Be responsible to deliver after learning and development opportunities by the organization as per 
desired and agreed commitments. 
3.4.2. HOD/Line Manager Responsibility 
It is important for the HOD/Line Manager to identify L&D needs in their team and should discuss these in line 
with the job description, performance objectives and relevant core competencies. HOD is responsible to:
