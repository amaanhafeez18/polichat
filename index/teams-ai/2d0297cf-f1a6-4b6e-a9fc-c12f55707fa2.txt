This Gender Action Plan (GAP) forms the basis for operationalizing the results and recommendations of the 
gender audit report. It contains specific gender elements to be considered in the operations of PSW and during 
the implementation of PSW measures and activities. Moreover, it helps to monitor the implementation of 
these measures and activities. Hence, the GAP ensures effective gender mainstreaming and integration of a 
consistent gender perspective in PSW to maximize benefits. The aim is to promote opportunities, drivers of 
change, and positive gender dynamics as well as to manage and mitigate potential adverse risks in PSW 
operations. 
 
The GAP ensures instituting a process of compliance within PSW functions, including a) internal organizational 
HR, gender, and anti-harassment policies; and b) external PSW’s single subscription forms and PSW’s 
platforms such as the trade information portal, and port community system. The GAP aims to strengthen 
Pakistan Single Window (PSW)’s internal and external policies, systems, and procedures by mainstreaming 
gender considerations and compliance areas, establishing a baseline level of performance on gender 
integration within PSW.
